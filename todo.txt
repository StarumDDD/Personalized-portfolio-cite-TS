the homepage is only normal the first time that I open the cite if thats how it should be then the following is irrelevant:
also the homepage is compleatly white and the animation does not play, but when I change to the projects tab and back to home it appears for a bit but then fades to white, maybe I need to add content to the cite for it to work? Or maybe there is some issue, test it and rewrite if needed
